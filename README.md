#### Intake: 
When Help Desk Agent/Admin logs in, they can now see the tickets that are available that have been assigned/not assigned with a provided priority. The priority will be set by help desk agent or queue manager working the tickets. The below screen shows the `Ticket #`, `Last Updated`, `Subject`, `From` (user that created the ticket), priority and `Assigned To` (queue manager can assign the ticket, person viewing the ticket can assign it to themselves or it can be assigned to a team ).
